1
00:00:00,522 --> 00:00:02,125
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,296
I really hoped that
when we put Sybil down,

3
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:06,201
it'd break whatever
control she had over him,

4
00:00:06,226 --> 00:00:07,539
but she still has ahold of him.

5
00:00:07,564 --> 00:00:10,238
Turn off your humanity,
pledge your loyalty to me.

6
00:00:10,263 --> 00:00:12,530
If anyone can pull me back
from the precipice, it's you.

7
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:13,543
I know you can.

8
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,833
There are two of us and
you've met my sister,

9
00:00:15,835 --> 00:00:18,102
- Seline.
- Seline is the other siren?

10
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:20,171
You're assuming that I'm
gonna let you remember this

11
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:21,572
when you wake up.

12
00:00:21,574 --> 00:00:23,726
Your intern, Georgie,
she broke into the house.

13
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:25,443
I mean, she's just
a little weirdo, right?

14
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:26,410
- Georgie.
- I'm here.

15
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:28,946
- Sorry.
- Wait!

16
00:00:28,948 --> 00:00:30,414
Why did you make me do that?

17
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:34,252
By the way, send Cade my regards.

18
00:00:35,676 --> 00:00:37,476
If this disrupts your psychic ability,

19
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:39,350
then why is Damon still your puppet?

20
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,408
I gave him a look at what awaits him,

21
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:44,539
and even that was enough to make
him flip his humanity switch.

22
00:00:44,564 --> 00:00:46,430
Damon believes in hell.

23
00:00:46,432 --> 00:00:48,686
I ripped into Tyler's throat last night.

24
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:50,944
Humanity or not, nobody
would forgive you for that.

25
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:54,165
Mmm. Why, I do declare,

26
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:57,278
this is some of the best
purple tea I've ever had.

27
00:01:57,303 --> 00:01:59,136
Mmm.

28
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:44,125

29
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,352
Dear Elena, I don't know where to start.

30
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,392
- Hey.
- Hey.

31
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:56,768
What are you doing here on your day off?

32
00:02:56,793 --> 00:02:58,963
Caroline told me you and
your friends lost someone.

33
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:00,831
- Yeah.
- I'm happy to take

34
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,100
the girls for the day if you need me to.

35
00:03:03,102 --> 00:03:04,602
I mean, that...

36
00:03:04,604 --> 00:03:06,737
that would be a huge help, actually.

37
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:07,738
Thank you.

38
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,540
Were you close with him?

39
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:11,942
Yeah, he was one of us.

40
00:03:11,944 --> 00:03:14,245
He was family.

41
00:03:14,247 --> 00:03:15,713
I get it.

42
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:17,281
I lost my family, too.

43
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:18,816
Everyone?

44
00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:20,084
I have a sister,

45
00:03:20,086 --> 00:03:22,425
but we're sort of estranged.

46
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,815
Hmm.

47
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,324
Yeah. Tyler's parents
died a few years ago.

48
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:28,626
He was the only Lockwood left.

49
00:03:28,628 --> 00:03:32,196
Now it's just a whole legacy...

50
00:03:32,198 --> 00:03:34,999
just gone.

51
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:36,834
I'm sure wherever Tyler is,

52
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:38,402
he's at peace.

53
00:03:38,404 --> 00:03:40,705
And he knows he was loved.

54
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:45,109
Look, I, uh...

55
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:46,377
I really need to head out.

56
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,312
Are you sure you don't mind?

57
00:03:48,314 --> 00:03:50,047
Not at all. Go.

58
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:51,515
I heard there's a carnival in town.

59
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:52,983
Thought it might be
nice to take the twins.

60
00:03:52,985 --> 00:03:54,647
Yeah. They would love that.

61
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:55,853
Seline.

62
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:57,560
Hey, you two.

63
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:59,018
Come play with us.

64
00:04:00,526 --> 00:04:02,426
Hi.

65
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:04,261
Hi.

66
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:05,296
Who can get their shoes on first?

67
00:04:05,298 --> 00:04:06,430
- Me.
- I can.

68
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:08,733
I can.

69
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:18,718
That's not gonna bring him back.

70
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,782
Tyler deserved more

71
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:24,048
than to be collateral
damage in whatever game

72
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,851
Sybil's playing with Damon.

73
00:04:26,853 --> 00:04:29,387
Yeah. I can't even remember
our last conversation.

74
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:31,889
We haven't talked in months.

75
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:34,392
We've both been so busy.

76
00:04:34,394 --> 00:04:36,026
After everything we went through,

77
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:39,864
I guess I just always assumed
that he would be there.

78
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:43,667
I'm at a loss with Damon.

79
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:46,937
I don't know what to do with him anymore.

80
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:51,470
Maybe the best thing to
do is just to mourn Tyler

81
00:04:51,495 --> 00:04:52,710
with your friends.

82
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:55,813
We all owe him that.

83
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,894
Oh, don't mind me, luv.

84
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:14,799
Something wrong?

85
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,901
I'm fine.

86
00:05:16,903 --> 00:05:18,135
Wow.

87
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:20,771
So Damon murders Tyler Lockwood,

88
00:05:20,773 --> 00:05:23,040
in cold blood, and you're fine with it.

89
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:25,176
I didn't mean to eavesdrop on your call,

90
00:05:25,178 --> 00:05:27,557
but that seems like a
decidedly not fine situation,

91
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:28,712
at least to me.

92
00:05:28,714 --> 00:05:31,515
But that grief that you're
trying damn hard to hide

93
00:05:31,517 --> 00:05:35,052
is giving you this beautiful glow.

94
00:05:37,557 --> 00:05:39,690
Set me free, Bonnie.

95
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:41,625
Set us both free.

96
00:05:41,627 --> 00:05:44,062
I'll take you on a proper date.

97
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:45,396
Anywhere you'd like.

98
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:47,031
Paris...

99
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:50,134
You can fix everything
that's broken inside of me.

100
00:05:50,136 --> 00:05:52,736
You can fix us.

101
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:59,777
Your wrists look a little raw.

102
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:05,749
I'll help you out.

103
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:11,255
Ah.

104
00:06:18,631 --> 00:06:19,997
Bonnie Bennett,

105
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:22,466
you are my saving grace.

106
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:31,709
You spelled the cabin?

107
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:33,410
You've been keeping a secret from me.

108
00:06:33,412 --> 00:06:34,845
Are you a witch again?

109
00:06:34,847 --> 00:06:36,447
I'm actually not.

110
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:38,048
Still don't have my magic,

111
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,084
but doesn't mean I can't
use a magical object.

112
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:42,853
This is a dark object
on loan from the Armory.

113
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:45,089
It's called a "flame of imprisonment."

114
00:06:45,091 --> 00:06:46,490
Well, aren't you fancy?

115
00:06:46,492 --> 00:06:48,431
It traps supernatural beings

116
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:49,907
in the space where it burns.

117
00:06:49,932 --> 00:06:51,795
I can come and go because
I'm the one who lit it.

118
00:06:51,797 --> 00:06:54,331
And I'm the only one who can put it out.

119
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,568
And I won't... unless you turn

120
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,036
your humanity back on.

121
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:01,372
Why are you suddenly taking this stand?

122
00:07:01,374 --> 00:07:03,574
Because Tyler Lockwood is dead.

123
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:06,110
And I'm not gonna lose you, too.

124
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:15,819
What are you doing?

125
00:07:22,228 --> 00:07:23,661
Savasana.

126
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:25,396
It's restorative.

127
00:07:25,398 --> 00:07:27,181
It promotes physical

128
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:29,633
and emotional well-being.

129
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,308
So not Zen.

130
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,176
- That's for Tyler.
- To be fair,

131
00:07:39,178 --> 00:07:41,345
that was more Damon than it was me.

132
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:43,547
I simply suggested that
he do whatever he could

133
00:07:43,549 --> 00:07:45,249
to sever his remaining ties.

134
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:49,153
Georgie, where is she?

135
00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:53,524
I already have another cell ready.

136
00:07:53,526 --> 00:07:55,593
Labeled Siren Number Two.

137
00:07:57,296 --> 00:07:59,830
Oh, wait, that's right,
I can't see anything.

138
00:07:59,832 --> 00:08:02,255
My psychic abilities have
been neutralized.

139
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,071
I set up an intercom system here.

140
00:08:07,073 --> 00:08:10,374
So this noise and pain will haunt you

141
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:13,010
from now on, 24/7.

142
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:16,413
Welcome to your psychic hell.

143
00:08:23,055 --> 00:08:24,655
- Intercom's up and running.
- Oh, good.

144
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,457
Listen, I need you to test
the frequency levels

145
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:27,758
every hour on the hour.

146
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,750
It's incredibly important.

147
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,101
Can I ask why?

148
00:08:30,126 --> 00:08:32,039
Well, because I believe
the vibrational motion

149
00:08:32,064 --> 00:08:34,431
had something to do with the
formation of the tunnels.

150
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:35,933
That makes almost no sense.

151
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:37,267
Okay, how about because I said so?

152
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:40,494
Also, I got a really odd text
from Georgie last night,

153
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,072
saying she had to leave town suddenly.

154
00:08:42,074 --> 00:08:43,574
She wouldn't ditch work.

155
00:08:43,576 --> 00:08:45,042
- Not while we're in the middle
of all this. - Agreed.

156
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:46,744
Which is why I need you
to do some digging.

157
00:08:46,746 --> 00:08:48,579
Call her roommate, find out what's up.

158
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:49,640
We need to find her right away.

159
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:51,115
What about the frequency research?

160
00:08:51,117 --> 00:08:52,583
Multi-task.

161
00:08:52,585 --> 00:08:54,618
Test the frequency, look for Georgie.

162
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,221
Call me if anything strange happens.

163
00:09:24,502 --> 00:09:26,368
I was wondering when you guys

164
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,470
were gonna show up.

165
00:09:28,472 --> 00:09:30,705
Body's probably starting
to smell a little bit.

166
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,603
Tried to keep it as intact as I could.

167
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:34,943
But I got to admit,
I got a little carried away

168
00:09:34,968 --> 00:09:38,145
about the whole ripping
the throat out thing.

169
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:39,792
My apologies to Donovan.

170
00:09:39,817 --> 00:09:42,351
I'm sure you cleaned him up real nice.

171
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:46,989
What are you gonna do with that?

172
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:48,223
Stake me?

173
00:09:48,225 --> 00:09:49,858
Go ahead, try it.

174
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,627
But first...

175
00:09:52,196 --> 00:09:54,396
Take your pick.

176
00:09:54,398 --> 00:09:57,332
'Cause I'm gonna bury every one of you.

177
00:10:02,392 --> 00:10:03,958
Easy.

178
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,593
Underestimating me

179
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:07,095
is what got Tyler killed.

180
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,466
Matt Donovan.

181
00:10:11,468 --> 00:10:13,101
The only living boy in Mystic Falls.

182
00:10:13,103 --> 00:10:15,907
You know, it's shocking you
managed to stay human this long.

183
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:17,093
Maybe I should fix that.

184
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:18,173
Is that why you came home, Damon?

185
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:19,474
To make empty threats?

186
00:10:19,476 --> 00:10:20,508
Not empty, brother.

187
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:24,078
Don't move or I'll snap his neck.

188
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,481
Give Matt here a
non-transferrable invitation

189
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:28,383
to our supernatural breakfast club.

190
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:31,085
Damon, enough.

191
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:32,921
Sweet Caroline. How many

192
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,690
innocent people did you kill on
your no humanity bender, hmm?

193
00:10:35,692 --> 00:10:38,126
Doesn't matter what you say or don't.

194
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:40,028
The devil knows what you did.

195
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,830
What's happened to you?

196
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:45,066
What's so surprising about this?

197
00:10:45,068 --> 00:10:46,601
I'm who I've always been.

198
00:10:46,603 --> 00:10:48,636
No. No, you're different.

199
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:52,969
Professor Ric Saltzman, everyone.

200
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:54,309
Certified genius.

201
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:56,344
Knows you better than you know yourself.

202
00:10:56,346 --> 00:10:58,513
Damon, just go.

203
00:10:58,515 --> 00:11:00,548
Nobody wants you here.

204
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:07,388
You all despise me, right?

205
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,990
Just so we're clear, hmm?

206
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:11,159
I killed Tyler, you hate my guts,

207
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:13,647
our ties are severed, huh? Great.

208
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:15,779
If you thought there was
any remaining opportunity

209
00:11:15,804 --> 00:11:20,301
to rescue me, let this prove you wrong.

210
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,141
It was awful.

211
00:11:27,143 --> 00:11:29,344
Like Damon's desperate
for us all to hate him.

212
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:30,845
Sorry I wasn't there.

213
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:33,114
I want to be there.
I just... I can't leave.

214
00:11:33,116 --> 00:11:35,342
Please tell me it's going
better than it did yesterday.

215
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:37,719
It's worse, if that's even possible.

216
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:40,321
Drying him out didn't work.
Starving him didn't work.

217
00:11:40,323 --> 00:11:43,273
I played the guitar.
I told him our history.

218
00:11:43,298 --> 00:11:44,993
It's like talking to a brick wall.

219
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,328
What did it for you, when you
had your humanity off?

220
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,097
What made you break free?

221
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:53,134
I had to face my biggest fear.

222
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:55,470
That I wasn't worth loving anymore.

223
00:11:55,472 --> 00:11:59,474
And that my mom would be ashamed of me.

224
00:11:59,476 --> 00:12:02,477
I had to be reminded how
much she loved me,

225
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:07,415
and then I had to
want to live up to that.

226
00:12:08,285 --> 00:12:09,918
Is that helpful?

227
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,086
Yeah.

228
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:13,555
It is.

229
00:12:13,557 --> 00:12:15,356
Keep me posted.

230
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:16,865
And don't worry about not being here.

231
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,294
We'll give Tyler a proper
good-bye when this is all over.

232
00:12:19,296 --> 00:12:21,896
- Yeah, when will that be?
- Soon.

233
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:23,131
I hope.

234
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:25,233
I hope so, too.

235
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:30,371
Dead friend problems?

236
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:33,374
My heart bleeds for you.

237
00:12:33,376 --> 00:12:35,510
All this trauma.

238
00:12:35,512 --> 00:12:37,845
The burden of always
having to protect everyone.

239
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:40,148
Why don't you just take me
off your plate, hmm?

240
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,585
Why don't you just turn
your humanity back on?

241
00:12:43,587 --> 00:12:47,322
Can't we both agree that
my humanity was a hindrance?

242
00:12:47,324 --> 00:12:49,624
I was angry, depressed.

243
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:51,926
A-A tragic poet full of darkness.

244
00:12:53,897 --> 00:12:55,797
Where's the fun in reverting back

245
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,866
to an inferior version of myself?

246
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:03,371
You were a lot of amazing things, too.

247
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:05,974
You were loyal, creative,

248
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:08,710
and wildly romantic.

249
00:13:08,712 --> 00:13:10,712
Mmm.

250
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:13,514
Well, you know, even if I did turn it on,

251
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:14,849
it's too late for you.

252
00:13:14,851 --> 00:13:17,185
You missed Tyler's funeral.

253
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:18,987
Abandoning your friends
in their time of need.

254
00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:21,322
That, my dear, is cold.

255
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:25,426
I'll be back.

256
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:31,065
I'll still be here.

257
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:33,601
Thanks to you.

258
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:39,240
Remember, it's not Damon.

259
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:41,576
This is Damon under the
control of a she-devil.

260
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:43,945
And we have to find a way to
break her control. And we will.

261
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:45,348
I've got my interns working on it.

262
00:13:45,373 --> 00:13:47,882
And, in the meantime,
what, let him run wild

263
00:13:47,884 --> 00:13:49,550
and kill another one of our friends?

264
00:13:49,552 --> 00:13:50,885
I am trying to prevent that, you know.

265
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:53,154
Look, even if we break Sybil's hold,

266
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:55,623
once Damon realizes what he's done,

267
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,993
what Elena will think of him,
he may not recover.

268
00:13:58,995 --> 00:14:01,162
What are you suggesting?

269
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:04,899
While we figure out how to
save Damon from the sirens,

270
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:06,234
we have to figure out

271
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:08,036
how to save him from himself.

272
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:10,638
We have to put him down.

273
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:13,041
For how long?

274
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:14,842
As long as we need to.

275
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:16,144
You sure?

276
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:19,013
It's for his own good.

277
00:14:19,015 --> 00:14:22,350
And it's the only way that
we can protect ourselves.

278
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,101
Well, this is a surprise.

279
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:32,570
To be clear, we're not friends,

280
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:34,362
and I'm not here to set you free.

281
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:36,964
In fact, I never want to see you again.

282
00:14:36,966 --> 00:14:40,535
- Why are you here then?
- Because I want answers.

283
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:43,337
I stole that hunk of junk
from Donovan's mystery dad.

284
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:44,839
Burned all my bridges.

285
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:46,974
Made everybody hate me. I'm guessing

286
00:14:46,976 --> 00:14:49,177
it's because you're still in my head.

287
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,445
And what makes you think that?

288
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:51,913
Because none of it's for me.

289
00:14:51,915 --> 00:14:54,282
I can't quite understand
why I have free will

290
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:55,516
and yet I'm still

291
00:14:55,518 --> 00:14:57,552
your errand boy. I do things

292
00:14:57,554 --> 00:15:01,055
to make you happy, and I don't know why.

293
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:03,458
Sounds like you have regrets.

294
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,427
Regret implies that you're
not a loyal servant.

295
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:08,996
What are you talking about?
I killed Tyler Lockwood.

296
00:15:08,998 --> 00:15:11,899
- Of course I'm loyal.
- No, you're upset

297
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:13,412
because you upset your friends.

298
00:15:13,437 --> 00:15:15,536
My friends don't care about me anymore.

299
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:17,405
But you killed someone
that they do care about.

300
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:19,173
That must've made them feel something.

301
00:15:19,175 --> 00:15:21,642
Sure looks like it made
you feel something.

302
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:23,845
Here you are, troubled, hostile.

303
00:15:23,847 --> 00:15:25,446
You know what that tells me?

304
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:26,981
That you're not completely mine.

305
00:15:26,983 --> 00:15:28,683
That the cold, dark heart

306
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:32,086
of Damon Salvatore felt a flash of pain

307
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:34,622
when he took Tyler Lockwood's life away.

308
00:15:34,624 --> 00:15:36,290
It made you feel,

309
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:38,126
and it felt bad.

310
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:39,942
I don't feel anything anymore.

311
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:40,995
Wrong.

312
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:42,797
It's written all over your face.

313
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,767
Your humanity is riding
that dimmer switch,

314
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:47,902
and right now it is pushing itself up.

315
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:49,670
And it feels terrible, doesn't it?

316
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:51,038
- Shut up.
- Dimmer goes up,

317
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,406
and you'll get your feelings back.

318
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:54,509
Maybe your brother will love you again.

319
00:15:54,511 --> 00:15:57,044
But, boy, will it feel awful.

320
00:15:57,046 --> 00:15:59,781
And Elena's reaction to
everything you've done,

321
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:01,382
let's not even think about that.

322
00:16:01,384 --> 00:16:03,651
Stop talking.

323
00:16:03,653 --> 00:16:06,463
Dimmer that switch back down,

324
00:16:06,488 --> 00:16:08,790
and all these bad feelings
and all this confusion,

325
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,858
it'll all disappear.

326
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,061
Me? I prefer Option B.

327
00:16:14,063 --> 00:16:17,465
The dimmer down. Total abandonment.

328
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,433
I said shut up.

329
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:22,403
Shut up!

330
00:16:22,405 --> 00:16:25,573
What do you want from me?

331
00:16:25,575 --> 00:16:27,842
I want you, Damon.

332
00:16:27,844 --> 00:16:29,744
All of you.

333
00:16:29,746 --> 00:16:32,280
I can rewrite your subconscious,
but that will only get me

334
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,781
so far.

335
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:35,116
I'm not going to have you

336
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:36,417
the way that I want you

337
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:37,718
while you still have

338
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,421
these emotional ties to your past.

339
00:16:47,463 --> 00:16:50,464
Go see your brother.

340
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:54,435
Let him guide that dimmer switch
up until you feel everything.

341
00:16:54,437 --> 00:16:57,672
If that's how you want to live
your life, go ahead... live it.

342
00:16:57,674 --> 00:17:02,118
Maybe you'll find some
small pockets of happiness

343
00:17:02,143 --> 00:17:05,055
before death delivers you to Cade.

344
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:30,379
Hey, uh, somebody just
dropped this off for you.

345
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:32,147
Said he was from the Armory?

346
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:34,269
Yeah. Just, uh, put it down.
I'll go through it later.

347
00:17:38,055 --> 00:17:41,890
Box everything up. Room by room.

348
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:46,528
Uh, Matt, you know, we
can do this tomorrow.

349
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,230
Or the day after, if you need time.

350
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:49,731
No, it's fine.

351
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:53,035
I'm an expert at dealing
with loss, you know?

352
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:55,003
Started at a young age.

353
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,508
Yeah, I guess I deserve that.

354
00:18:00,878 --> 00:18:04,413
You do and you don't.

355
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,982
I'm sorry. It's just...

356
00:18:06,984 --> 00:18:09,618
Tyler and this place

357
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,922
and the fact that I have
vampire blood in my system.

358
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:17,526
And if I die in the next 24 hours,
I'm gonna become one.

359
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:20,596
How did it come to this?

360
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:21,830
How did all this happen?

361
00:18:21,832 --> 00:18:23,532
"All this"?

362
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:27,603
What do you mean? Like vampires

363
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:29,738
and vervain and...

364
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:33,175
...and death?

365
00:18:33,177 --> 00:18:35,177
This was my life.

366
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:36,578
This is what I dealt with.

367
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,615
Alone. For a long time.

368
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:42,551
This is what I wanted to escape.

369
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:45,287
So, forgive me

370
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:48,357
if I'm not in the mood to
give you a history lesson.

371
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:14,616
Matt, if you got this,

372
00:19:14,618 --> 00:19:17,853
it means I'm dead, which sucks.

373
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:22,591
It also means I need your
help finding someone.

374
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:36,939
Thought you were gone for the day.

375
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:38,473
Hey, take a look at this, will you?

376
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:40,542
Yeah.

377
00:19:40,544 --> 00:19:42,978
So, the distance between
Mystic Falls and the Armory

378
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,938
is roughly 35 miles.

379
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:46,415
Winding roads, hill country.

380
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:47,749
But I was able to walk the distance

381
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:49,284
of that tunnel in just a few hours.

382
00:19:49,286 --> 00:19:52,521
Which would make it, what, seven miles?

383
00:19:52,523 --> 00:19:54,456
The tunnel must cut directly
under the mountains.

384
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,959
Right. But the walls are old.

385
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:58,226
Centuries, at least.

386
00:19:58,228 --> 00:19:59,728
So who the hell built them?

387
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,829
And why?

388
00:20:00,831 --> 00:20:01,997
Hmm.

389
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:03,565
You want me to get into it?

390
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:06,468
No. No, I'll figure it out.

391
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,504
- So what's the latest on Georgie?
- I called her roommate.

392
00:20:09,506 --> 00:20:11,473
She said all of Georgie's
stuff is still in her room.

393
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:13,075
If she left, she didn't
take anything with her.

394
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:14,476
Okay, I need you to call the police

395
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:15,777
and file a missing persons report.

396
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:16,912
Seriously?

397
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:18,146
It's just a precaution.

398
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:19,815
How's the frequency research coming?

399
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:21,850
You keep acting like I'm
doing something scientific.

400
00:20:21,852 --> 00:20:23,482
I'm literally banging a fork.

401
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:25,320
It's ridiculous, and I've
learned nothing.

402
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:27,856
You ever gonna tell me
what this is all about?

403
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:31,259
One day.

404
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:43,638
Good try.

405
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,774
Almost.

406
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:47,743
This is too hard.

407
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:49,077
Oh.

408
00:20:54,785 --> 00:20:56,284
Why don't you give the girls

409
00:20:56,286 --> 00:20:58,954
a goldfish for their efforts?

410
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:02,391
We'll take that one.

411
00:21:03,694 --> 00:21:06,695
Is he sick?

412
00:21:06,697 --> 00:21:08,597
Aw, I think he might be dead.

413
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,399
But that's okay. Tell you what,

414
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:12,834
we'll take him home and
give him a proper burial.

415
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:14,736
- Okay.
- Okay?

416
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,910
I swear,

417
00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:24,713
if Seline wasn't so good with
the girls, I would hate her.

418
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:27,516
She's too perfect to be a real person.

419
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:29,184
- Who's that for?
- Got a text from Damon

420
00:21:29,186 --> 00:21:30,144
a little while ago.

421
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:31,887
He wants to meet up at the carnival.

422
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:33,855
- Why the carnival?
- I don't know.

423
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,816
But this is my only chance,
I don't know if I'll get another

424
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,625
so I have to take it.

425
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:38,191
- Are you gonna need some help?
- No.

426
00:21:38,216 --> 00:21:40,362
I'm not putting you in any
more danger, Caroline.

427
00:21:40,364 --> 00:21:43,365
Two vampires are better
than one, it's basic math.

428
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:46,334
I have to do this on my own.

429
00:21:47,438 --> 00:21:49,604
It's the right thing.

430
00:21:49,606 --> 00:21:51,740
Okay? You know it is.

431
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:56,878
He might not forgive me after this.

432
00:21:58,246 --> 00:22:01,950
And I might lose him forever.

433
00:22:01,952 --> 00:22:04,386
You already lost him.

434
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,303
Happy New Year's, luv.

435
00:22:21,305 --> 00:22:22,938
Come on, dance with me.

436
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,239
Hmm? Like we used to.

437
00:22:24,241 --> 00:22:26,341
Oh, I remember now, all the lights,

438
00:22:26,343 --> 00:22:28,076
the music, mmm.

439
00:22:28,078 --> 00:22:29,778
Screw you.

440
00:22:30,423 --> 00:22:32,557
You didn't buy it? Not just a little?

441
00:22:32,582 --> 00:22:34,449
I'm glad you found a new
way to amuse yourself.

442
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:35,584
Yeah, sorry. Can't help it.

443
00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:39,154
Romance... the slow burn of it all.

444
00:22:39,156 --> 00:22:40,451
Oh, it was so

445
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:42,791
unbelievably saccharine.

446
00:22:42,793 --> 00:22:44,757
And for what? I kept you safe

447
00:22:44,782 --> 00:22:47,449
for three years and then
you tried to kill me.

448
00:22:48,398 --> 00:22:50,565
It looks like

449
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:52,400
you might be trying that again?

450
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:54,269
I'm gonna get through to you.

451
00:22:54,271 --> 00:22:56,004
I'm gonna use your darkest fears

452
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:57,672
to pull you out of this.

453
00:22:57,674 --> 00:23:00,108
Okay, well, I'm a complicated person.

454
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,177
In my 140 years on this Earth,

455
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:04,012
- no one's figured me out.
- Oh, well.

456
00:23:04,014 --> 00:23:05,580
Guess I'll die trying.

457
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,985
Oh.

458
00:23:09,987 --> 00:23:12,355
You think I'm afraid of fire

459
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,223
because Damon left me in a fire.

460
00:23:15,225 --> 00:23:17,259
Nice try.

461
00:23:17,261 --> 00:23:18,960
But no.

462
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:22,898
You're afraid of people leaving.

463
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,166
Period.

464
00:23:24,168 --> 00:23:26,735
You're afraid of being abandoned.

465
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:29,771
The one thing that happens
to you again and again.

466
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:33,708
- Everyone leaves, no one stays.
- Hmm.

467
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,810
Well, that ends now.

468
00:23:35,812 --> 00:23:38,680
'Cause I'm not going anywhere.

469
00:23:38,682 --> 00:23:40,015
Yeah, well...

470
00:23:40,017 --> 00:23:42,584
This is a bit extreme, don't you think?

471
00:23:42,586 --> 00:23:46,721
Well, desperate times call
for desperate measures.

472
00:23:46,723 --> 00:23:49,691
I'm not leaving until you
turn your humanity back on.

473
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:52,561
I'd rather burn alive than abandon you.

474
00:24:16,386 --> 00:24:17,686
Hey, what's going on?

475
00:24:17,688 --> 00:24:20,589
Gas leak, we're being evacuated.

476
00:24:26,997 --> 00:24:29,297
Hello, brother.

477
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:34,569
Stefan.

478
00:24:34,571 --> 00:24:36,671
I need your help.

479
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,903
I got to say, I'm surprised.

480
00:24:45,905 --> 00:24:46,873
Last time I saw you,

481
00:24:46,898 --> 00:24:48,906
you seemed pretty
hell-bent on severing ties.

482
00:24:48,931 --> 00:24:51,528
Yeah, in hindsight, that might
have been a bit dramatic.

483
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,444
Well, it's a little late to take it back.

484
00:24:53,446 --> 00:24:54,779
Even if Sybil made you do it.

485
00:24:54,804 --> 00:24:57,381
Yeah, see, this is where it gets tricky.

486
00:24:57,383 --> 00:24:59,717
I want to serve her,
Stefan, I mean, I have to.

487
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:01,112
And serving her keeps me away

488
00:25:01,137 --> 00:25:02,753
from the big bad devil himself.

489
00:25:02,755 --> 00:25:03,988
And I want to stay away from hell

490
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,556
as long as humanly possible.

491
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:07,899
- By turning off your humanity?
- There are worse fates.

492
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:08,859
You know I can help you.

493
00:25:08,861 --> 00:25:11,128
If you let me.

494
00:25:12,465 --> 00:25:14,899
You're gonna make me turn it back on.

495
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:16,088
No.

496
00:25:16,113 --> 00:25:18,414
No, I-I-I-I-I don't want
to do that, Stefan.

497
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:19,437
You have to.

498
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,105
You can't keep doing what you're doing.

499
00:25:21,107 --> 00:25:23,174
Why not? Isn't this easier?

500
00:25:23,176 --> 00:25:25,176
There are no amends to be made, Stefan.

501
00:25:25,178 --> 00:25:27,442
I can't munch on bunnies and save people,

502
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:29,146
and work my way back to peace.

503
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,962
I'm hell-bound.

504
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:33,597
So, why? Tell me.

505
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,467
Knowing what I know, why would
I ever want to feel again?

506
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:38,235
Because if we can't feel,

507
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,771
then what's the point
of being alive, huh?

508
00:25:43,423 --> 00:25:45,223
Exactly, brother.

509
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,714
- What's the point?
- No.

510
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,316
I'm not buying it.

511
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:55,252
I can see your humanity trying
to break through, Damon.

512
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:56,520
Come home with me.

513
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:58,522
I can help you be happy again.

514
00:25:58,524 --> 00:25:59,756
How?

515
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,025
It'll take time and work.

516
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,294
But I'll be there for you.

517
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:08,966
I-I... I can't, Stefan.

518
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:11,001
- I ruined everything.
- Hey.

519
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,270
I am your brother,

520
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:15,706
and I love you.

521
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:18,709
Just come home with me.

522
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:23,247
No... I can't.

523
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,421
Is that how you help me? Vervain?

524
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,357
I don't have any choice, you don't
know what you're doing.

525
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,025
I know exactly what I'm doing, brother.

526
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:36,560
Humanity's gone dark.

527
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,862
Anything goes now.

528
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,649
Congratulations, you nailed it.

529
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:00,918
Fear of abandonment, a textbook case.

530
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,554
- Now can we end this?
- I'm not leaving you.

531
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:05,055
I really hope you leave at some point.

532
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,690
I mean, this cabin's
gonna run out of food.

533
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:08,225
I really question UberEat"

534
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,660
ability to locate this address.

535
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:12,062
I'm not leaving you.

536
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:13,397
- I know. I get it.
- No.

537
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:17,901
Smoke doesn't feel good
in the lungs, does it?

538
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,805
I'm not leaving you.

539
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,173
And I still don't care.

540
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:25,375
Now you're just being stupid.

541
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,984
I'm not leaving you.

542
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:38,488
Any other last words?

543
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,095
I'm...

544
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:47,965
not...

545
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:50,300
leaving...

546
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:52,336
...you.

547
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,171
You're as good as dead.

548
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,710
I'm not...

549
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,898
Bonnie.

550
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,835
Bonnie, wake up.

551
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:46,723
Are we gonna bury the fish?

552
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,892
Yes, but in our own way.

553
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:52,663
You see, we are made up of two parts.

554
00:28:52,665 --> 00:28:55,666
Our body and our soul.

555
00:28:55,668 --> 00:29:00,214
See, some people are very special.

556
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,905
And when they die,

557
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,474
a man named Cade

558
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,476
comes to take their soul away.

559
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,945
- Does he take the body, too?
- No.

560
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,948
But that doesn't mean the
bodies aren't special, too.

561
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,184
They need to be treated with dignity

562
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,953
to find peace in death.

563
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,222
And Cade respects that.

564
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:22,592
He appreciates the effort.

565
00:29:24,697 --> 00:29:26,163
Let's show him what we did.

566
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:27,998
- How?
- We can call him.

567
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,430
But I need you to hold my hand, okay?

568
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,799
Did we hurt you?

569
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:45,382
Oh, not at all, you were perfect.

570
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:48,418
You took just the right amount of magic.

571
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,689
Now... I need you to say the special word.

572
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:54,524
Incendia.

573
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:00,781
Excellent job, girls.

574
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:05,369
- I think you're ready.
- For what?

575
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:08,338
It's a surprise.

576
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:27,858
Enzo!

577
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,130
You came back to me.

578
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:34,598
Of course I did.

579
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,334
Someone had to save you.

580
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:41,338
- No... No!
- Bonnie.

581
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:43,940
My time.

582
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:53,850
You loved me more than anyone.

583
00:30:57,923 --> 00:30:59,356
That's enough.

584
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:07,964
No! I'm not leaving you.

585
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,672
Bonnie!

586
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,742
I'm sorry. Sorry.

587
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,644
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

588
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,548
It's okay. It's okay. We're okay.

589
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:29,252
I almost killed you.

590
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,487
I'm still here.

591
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,623
Look at me.

592
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,793
You're okay now.

593
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:39,095
You're okay.

594
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:42,232
And you're stuck with me forever.

595
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:49,406
'Cause I'm never leaving.

596
00:32:29,643 --> 00:32:32,611
I'm sorry.

597
00:32:50,464 --> 00:32:52,831
What's all this?

598
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:54,800
You don't want to know.

599
00:32:54,802 --> 00:32:56,635
Try me.

600
00:32:56,637 --> 00:32:59,671
Tyler was helping this girl
named Virginia St. John

601
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:02,874
locate the sirens who escaped the vault.

602
00:33:02,876 --> 00:33:06,001
Well, she had all this
research and letters and stuff

603
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:08,346
from her great-grandfather, Dalton.

604
00:33:08,348 --> 00:33:11,603
He released one of the sirens in 1883.

605
00:33:11,628 --> 00:33:14,686
Then Virginia died and she
willed all this to Tyler.

606
00:33:14,688 --> 00:33:16,254
Then he died.

607
00:33:16,256 --> 00:33:18,256
- And now...
- And he wants

608
00:33:18,258 --> 00:33:20,859
you to take over where he left off.

609
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,897
I'm not the right guy for the job.

610
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:27,564
Okay? I-I ran away.

611
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,001
I left, you know? Tyler knew that.

612
00:33:30,003 --> 00:33:34,232
Maybe he saw what I see in you now.

613
00:33:34,257 --> 00:33:36,274
That you're brave.

614
00:33:36,276 --> 00:33:37,776
And fearless.

615
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:41,446
Impossibly resilient.

616
00:33:41,448 --> 00:33:44,449
And you got here all on your own.

617
00:33:44,451 --> 00:33:46,618
No thanks to me.

618
00:34:04,204 --> 00:34:05,701
This is Dorian.

619
00:34:05,726 --> 00:34:08,209
This is Detective Sudano,
Grove Hill Police.

620
00:34:08,234 --> 00:34:12,844
You were listed as a contact
person for Georgina Dowling?

621
00:34:12,846 --> 00:34:14,913
Is she okay?

622
00:34:19,353 --> 00:34:22,520
You should come down here.

623
00:35:36,945 --> 00:35:38,845
Thanks for coming.

624
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:42,349
I thought we could give
the funeral another shot.

625
00:35:43,218 --> 00:35:45,185
Welcome back.

626
00:35:56,832 --> 00:36:00,467
We're here to... honor Tyler.

627
00:36:03,605 --> 00:36:05,438
He was strong.

628
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,169
In the face of so much loss.

629
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:11,386
He fought

630
00:36:11,411 --> 00:36:13,179
the darkness inside himself and won.

631
00:36:13,181 --> 00:36:15,515
I respected the hell out of him.

632
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:20,587
Tyler was willing to
sacrifice everything for us.

633
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:24,457
He cared about all of us.

634
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:27,727
And he was my best friend.

635
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:35,502
He was so much more than a small-town kid

636
00:36:35,504 --> 00:36:39,539
and he lived so much more
than a small-town life.

637
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:42,175
I loved him.

638
00:36:42,177 --> 00:36:44,311
You know, we all did.

639
00:36:44,313 --> 00:36:46,646
Look, we don't know

640
00:36:46,648 --> 00:36:49,583
what'll happen next to any of us.

641
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:53,186
But we can't let that haunt us.

642
00:36:53,188 --> 00:36:57,026
We can't let that make us forget
what we mean to one another.

643
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,806
A few years ago, I sat on top

644
00:37:06,831 --> 00:37:08,535
of that Ferris wheel with Elena

645
00:37:08,537 --> 00:37:13,640
and I told her how important it
was to appreciate these moments.

646
00:37:14,476 --> 00:37:20,046
Because moments are all we have.

647
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:27,654
So in honor

648
00:37:27,656 --> 00:37:29,889
of Tyler and Elena,

649
00:37:29,891 --> 00:37:32,892
we need to keep creating
moments like these.

650
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,298
We need to remember to live.

651
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,094
Dear Elena...

652
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,253
We missed you today.

653
00:38:00,255 --> 00:38:04,496
It was a bad one in a
long series of bad ones.

654
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,595
But you'd like how we came out of it.

655
00:38:09,398 --> 00:38:13,800
I think we made you proud.

656
00:38:16,071 --> 00:38:18,638
Wow.

657
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,875
You know, I realized that
I never said thank you.

658
00:38:21,877 --> 00:38:25,159
I'm going to be your wife.

659
00:38:25,184 --> 00:38:27,647
Which means helping you
and protecting you.

660
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:30,550
Even saving you, if I have to.

661
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:33,219
Well, hopefully you won't
have to do that anymore.

662
00:38:34,923 --> 00:38:37,657
I remember the last time that
we were at this carnival.

663
00:38:37,659 --> 00:38:40,493
I didn't know how I could possibly deal

664
00:38:40,495 --> 00:38:42,996
with an eternity of being a vampire.

665
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:46,405
And you told me the only
way to get through it

666
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:49,369
is to tell yourself that
you're strong enough.

667
00:38:49,371 --> 00:38:51,871
Every day.

668
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:53,907
Stefan,

669
00:38:53,909 --> 00:38:55,661
you're strong enough.

670
00:38:55,686 --> 00:38:57,586
And if you ever doubt that,

671
00:38:57,588 --> 00:38:59,688
I'm gonna be here to remind you.

672
00:39:14,913 --> 00:39:17,240
Hey, I was just checking in.

673
00:39:17,265 --> 00:39:18,036
Hey.

674
00:39:18,061 --> 00:39:20,943
The girls are doing a little arts
and crafts project before bed.

675
00:39:20,945 --> 00:39:22,845
And I got a little carried away

676
00:39:22,847 --> 00:39:24,629
organizing the garage.

677
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,381
Wow, you're the best.

678
00:39:26,383 --> 00:39:27,883
And thank you for staying late,

679
00:39:27,885 --> 00:39:29,590
and working on your night off.

680
00:39:29,615 --> 00:39:31,920
I... couldn't have got
through today without you.

681
00:39:31,922 --> 00:39:34,256
What can I say? I love your girls.

682
00:39:34,258 --> 00:39:35,924
They keep me feeling young.

683
00:39:35,926 --> 00:39:37,392
I'll be heading home soon.

684
00:39:37,394 --> 00:39:38,794
No rush.

685
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:46,468
Thank you.

686
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,170
You're a doll.

687
00:39:50,341 --> 00:39:52,541
- You're here.
- Of course I am.

688
00:39:52,543 --> 00:39:54,977
- What happened?
- I saw the truth.

689
00:39:54,979 --> 00:39:57,412
Feelings make you weak.

690
00:39:57,414 --> 00:39:59,848
- I'm done feeling.
- Good.

691
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,917
Now, is your little
existential crisis over?

692
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:03,552
Because we have things to do.

693
00:40:03,554 --> 00:40:05,921
It'll be fun, I promise.

694
00:40:12,096 --> 00:40:13,462
I'm all yours.

695
00:40:20,191 --> 00:40:22,224
You must be starving.

696
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:44,448
You gonna be mad if I tell you
I'm happy to have you back here?

697
00:40:44,473 --> 00:40:47,496
I just wish it were under
better circumstances.

698
00:40:47,498 --> 00:40:49,131
I'm sorry that I've been M.I.A.

699
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:51,120
I've just been going through some stuff.

700
00:40:51,145 --> 00:40:53,335
Story of our lives.

701
00:40:53,337 --> 00:40:55,704
So how are the girls?

702
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:58,674
Practically teenagers.

703
00:40:58,676 --> 00:41:03,078
So I'm guessing you have a photo or two.

704
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,614
Uh, that's them playing
with the puppy filter,

705
00:41:05,616 --> 00:41:07,913
first day of school,

706
00:41:07,938 --> 00:41:10,319
uh, crafting at a
friend's birthday party...

707
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:11,377
Oh, I love this.

708
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,999
'Line sent it, from from earlier today.

709
00:41:14,024 --> 00:41:16,225
- Seline?
- Mm-hmm.

710
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:18,126
The nanny.

711
00:41:18,128 --> 00:41:20,996
I know, Ric hired the hot nanny.

712
00:41:20,998 --> 00:41:23,732
No, Caroline, you need to get home now.

713
00:41:25,202 --> 00:41:27,069
Lizzie?

714
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:29,204
Hey, Josie?

715
00:41:29,206 --> 00:41:30,995
- Girls?
- Lizzie?

716
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,141
- Girls?
- Josie?

717
00:41:33,143 --> 00:41:35,911
Girls?

718
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:37,379
Girls!

719
00:41:37,381 --> 00:41:39,581
Girls?

720
00:41:43,187 --> 00:41:45,387
Ric...

721
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:58,363
